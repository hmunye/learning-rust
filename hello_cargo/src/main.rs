// The main function is always the first code to run in a Rust program
//
// Uses C like syntax with curly braces wrapping the function body, parentheses to pass in
// parameters, and semicolons (;) to end expressions
fn main() {
    // This line calls a Rust macro, signified by the '!'
    //
    // Here, a string literal is passed as an argument to 'println!' and is printed to stdout
    println!("Hello, world!");
